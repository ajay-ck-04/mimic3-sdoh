presence of the humerus fracture it is unclear when this fracture occurred presumably it could have occurred during transportation given that the patient has no history of falling the fracture was significantly displaced and significantly angulated the patient received alternative hemodialysis access and the left upper extremity fistula was left at this point unused in preparation for possible surgery to address the humerus fracture the patient has so far not  develop any healing or callus on films i think this is not unusual given her medical history and believe a repair of this part humerus fracture would probably result in a non  and i therefore believe that the approach to address her fracture instability surgically is to perform a hemiarthroplasty the family agrees and she now presents for procedure  procedure in detail  the patient was brought to the operating room and after the successful induction of general anesthesia was placed in the beachchair position the left upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner via the deltopectoral approach the fracture was exposed there was significant soft tissue  scarring but no callous and there was good lateral perfusion on the soft tissues which bleed considerably this is secondary to the presence of the fistula nearby hemostasis was achieved with  electrocautery the deltopectoral interval was found and the fracture was exposed the humeral head lesser tuberosity and greater tuberosity were osteotomized and preserved and the remaining head was removed the canal was exposed and reamed and broached to accept a  mm osteonics humeral prosthesis a  mm humeral head was then selected and was found to give appropriate fit and range of motion at this point the canal was irrigated the final components were then brought to the field and cemented with one bag of pmma cement the final components were assembled and the lesser tuberosity and greater tuberosity were repaired over the prosthesis using the threaded holes in the prosthesis  the wound was copiously irrigated and closed in layers with  pds and  nylon over a drain dr  was present for the entire procedure all counts of sponges and instruments were correct c arm imaging was used at the end of the procedure to establish the appropriate height and anatomy was restored the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery room without incident dr  was present for the entire procedure  ct head   findings there is no acute intra or extraaxial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures the ventricles

increased intracranial pressure mental statusneurolic function slowly improved with increased response to commands and increased amount of communication however over the next several days it was determined that the evd was infected with coagulase negative staphylococcus which was treated with both intravenous and intraventricular vancomycin until cultures from csf were negative for seven consecutive days the evd was then removed and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed without complication the patients mental status continued to improve and at the time of discharge decadron had been weaned to mg qd the patient was placed on a regiment of keppra to maintain seizure prophylaxis metastatic lung cancer although it was felt that the patient had an overall poor prognosis it was felt that she may still benefit from a palliative standpoint from aggressive treatment completed one cycle of taxol as above was scheduled for repeated chemotherapy but delayed due to evd infection

No intracranial bleed. No hip\\nfracture. + R humerus fracture. CT of c-spine showed severe\\nstenosis. She was initially admitted to the medicine service for\\nworkup of syncope; neurology was consulted for a weak right arm\\nfollowing R humeral fracture and she was found to have a mixed\\ncentral cord and Brown-Sequard syndrome and transferred to the\\nneurology service for closer exam monitoring.  She underwent  R\\nhumerus ORIF and C2-C6 laminectomy and fusion on [**2134-3-2**]. A med\\nconsult was obtained on [**2134-3-4**] for persistent hypoxia. She was\\ngently diuresed, and had serial ABG\\'s which showed persistent\\nhypercarbia. During the admission, she was also treated with\\nCipro for a UTI.\\n.\\nNeuro: The patient could not recall the events surrounding the\\nfall and sustained a spiral fracture to the right proximal\\nhumerus, displaced, and had bilateral arm weakness and numbness\\ndistally in all 4 extremities.  On exam she initially was found\\nto have evidence of a central cord syndrome with weakness\\naffecting arms more so than legs.  She also had evidence of a\\nbrown sequard given that weakness and proprioception are down on\\nthe right with an upgoing toe, and pin sensation is down on the\\nleft, sensory level of C4/T3 anteriorly on the left (where the\\ntwo dermatomes meet at the top of the breast).  She was\\ncomplaining of neck pain, and had had trouble voiding so a foley\\nwas placed.\\n.\\nMRI of the C-spine was performed for the likelihood of acute\\nspinal cord injury with above findings.  Read of MRI was: \"Bulky\\nossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2/3,\\nC3/4, and C4/5 levels, more than the right, causing severe\\nspinal canal stenosis.The cervical cord at those levels is\\ndeformed and compressed, demonstrating intrinsic T2 hyperintense\\nsignal.  There is also a fracture at the inferior endplate of C3\\nanteriorly.\"  She was placed in a hard cervical collar and pain\\nwas controlled with morphine and ibuprofen initially.  She was\\nseen by both neurosurgery and orthopedics for the injury as both\\nservices had been alternately covering the spine service in the\\nhospital.  Orthopedics also followed her for the broken right\\nhumerus, and neurosurgery had initially been consulted in the ED\\nwhen a head ct showed the question of a subdural hematoma (later\\nproven to be artifactual).\\n.\\nBoth [**Date Range **] and neurosurgery agreed that it was safest for the\\npatient to hold off on the spine surgery for at least a week to\\nallow cord swelling to heal before operating.  She remained in a\\nhard collar during this time and her exam improved over the next\\nweek; the pinprick sensory level retracted to the T12 region for\\ndays, then finally seemed to vanish altogether; the\\nproprioceptive changes on the right also resolved.  Although the\\nright arm remained weak and flaccid with just [**2-28**] finger flexors\\nand trapezius/shoulder shrug [**2-28**] (initially thought just limited\\nby pain versus multiple nerve injury), the left arm strength\\nimproved to deltoid [**3-31**], [**Hospital1 **]/tri both 4+ to 5-/5, and wrist and\\nfinger extensors 4+/5; finger flexors were also 4+/5.  On [**4-9**]: there were no changes in exam.  For neuropathic pain,\\nneurontin had been initiated (patient later requested d/c to\\nsimplify med regimen).\\n.\\nThe weekend of [**2-27**] on morning rounds, a mild right Horner\\'s\\nsyndrome was noted which had not been picked up before on daily\\nrounds.  This, along with the flaccid arm, was suggestive of\\nroot avulsion on the right (and associated plexopathy).\\nHer neurologic symptoms all gradually resolved during\\nhospitalization.\\n.\\n[**Date Range 1957**]:\\nPt underwent R humerus ORIF and cervical laminectomy (report\\nbelow), however pt post-op, the medicine service was consulted\\nfor hypoxia (pt required 50% shovel mask) and hypercarbia (pCO2\\nin high 50\\'s). She has a follow up appointment on [**3-18**] with\\n[**Month/Year (2) **] to evaluate her fracture and decide whether her C-collar\\ncan be removed.\\n.\\nHypoxia/hypercarbia:\\nPt had hx of severe pulm HTM, likely [**1-28**] PDA. ABG showed mild\\nCO2 retention, ? if this was close to her baseline. Also likely\\nhad component of fluid overload, given recent surgery.  Pt was\\ngently diuresed with IV Lasix. Narcotics were d/c\\'d as pt\\nappeared somnolent. O2 was successfully weaned down to 2L NC (pt\\napparently had been on 2L O2 at home). CTA on admission was\\nnegative for PE, and the suspicion for PE was fairly low post-op\\ngiven that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement\\nimproved.  Therefore, repeat CTA was not done. She was also\\nnoted to be hypercarbic during admission, but her respiratory\\nstatus remained stable while on the medicine service.\\n.\\nStatus post fall: The original fall was of unclear etiology. The\\ndifferential included vasovagal syncope versus new onset\\nafib/atach versus mechanical given loss of consciousness. Less\\nlikely include myocardial infarction/ischemia versus pulmonary\\nembolism versus seizure. Also less likely hypoglycemia given\\ntiming after meal although patinet on glyburide which is renally\\ncleared in setting of increased creatinine.  The patient ruled\\nout for MI by cardiac enzymes, echo showed no obvious severe\\nvalvular disease to explain ?syncopal event, though telemetry\\nshowed periodic tachyarrhythmia ?sinus tach vs afib.  She had no\\nother significant tele events while in the hospital.\\n.\\nElevated WBC and lactate at admission: unclear etiology,\\nafebrile with negative UA and infectious workup at admission.\\nThis cleared on its own.  Later in hospitalization ([**2-27**]) she had\\na UTI treated with course of ciprofloxacin. Urine cxlood cx, and\\ncath tip cx were sent prior to d/c to workup somnolence, however\\npt\\'s somnolence cleared and cx\\'s were pending on d/c. These\\nshould be followed at her follow up appointments.\\n.\\nMusculoskeletal: initially, radiographic imaging was negative\\nfor fracture or bleed including right UE, hips bilaterally,\\nc-spine and head. Patient with known chronic low back pain and\\nsciatica.\\n.\\nHypertension/pulmonary hypertension: continued ASA, held\\nvalsartan. lasix initially held for renal failure but was\\nrestarted once she was clinically stable.\\n.\\nHypercholesterolemia: continued home dose of lipitor\\n.\\nRenal: She has slight renal insufficiency at admission and was\\ngiven gentle IVF. Her electrolytes were followed and repleted as\\nneeded, MVI and continued niferex.  ARF improved. She should\\nhave her potassium and BUN/creatinine followed at regular\\nintervals starting 2-3 days post discharge, as she was\\ndischarged on her home dose of [**Last Name (un) **] and new dose of lasix.\\n\\nProphylaxis: The patient was maintained on TEDS, SQ heparin,\\nPPI, bowel regimen.
